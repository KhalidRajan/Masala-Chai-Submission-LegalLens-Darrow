Source code for shared task organized by Darrow to explore novel Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Natural Language Inference (NLI) techniques in the legal domain.

- Experimented with 15+ different models including BERT-based transformer models, OpenAI GPT models, LLama 3.1 8B and Falcon 7B. Adopted different methods to adapt these models to the task including full-fine tuning, LoRa, and QLoRa.

Co-authored a paper articulating experiments and results that has been accepted to Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) 2024 and Natural Legal Language Processing (NLLP) 2024.
